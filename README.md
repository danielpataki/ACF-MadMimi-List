# ACF - Google Font Selector Field

A field for Advanced Custom Fields which allows you to select one or more of your MadMimi audience lists


## Description

[MadMimi](http://madmimi.com) is an email marketing tool that allows you to send emails to email lists easily. It comes with a great API which is the basis for this ACF addon.

This plugin allows you to create a MadMimi audience list selector field. You can set it to allow multiple selections and you can dictate the data that is returned.
